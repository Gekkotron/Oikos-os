//! The flow engine: turns state changes and manual requests into runs.
//!
//! Boot and reconnect safety is the point of the `known` map. The broker replays every retained
//! state when the hub (re)connects, and those replays must never start a run: a light switching
//! because the hub restarted is worse than a light that misses one trigger. So a trigger only
//! fires on a change between two values the engine itself has seen, and the map is emptied
//! whenever the link drops or the engine falls behind the event stream. Every report of a
//! watched entity (changed or not) missing from the map seeds it silently again, so an
//! identical retained replay arms the entity without firing.
//!
//! Values are tracked per (entity, field): a trigger on a vacuum's battery and one on its state
//! fire independently, each on a change of its own value.
