        "Oikos-os is the hub of a Zigbee2MQTT home behind a Mosquitto broker: devices are the \
         Zigbee nodes, entities are their Home Assistant discovery entries (lights, switches, \
         covers, climates, sensors and so on) and areas are the rooms. `list_entities` hides \
         diagnostic, config, disabled-by-default and folded entities unless you pass \
         `include: \"all\"`; use `search` to find a device or an entity by name and `get_entity` \
         to see an entity's MQTT bindings (topics, templates) and its raw override. \
         `set_override` writes the Android app's `oikos/ui/<id>` override (fields: {fields}; \
         `null` clears a field) and `clear_override` removes it. `send_command` publishes to \
         the device and reports `accepted: true` once the next state echo confirms it, or \
         `accepted: false` with the reason; a generic entity (lock, fan, siren, scene, text and so on) \
         takes `{{\"type\":\"control\",\"control\":\"<name>\",\"value\":...}}` with a name from its \
         `capabilities.generic.controls`, and a control with no state to echo is accepted as soon \
         as it is published. The `oikos://snapshot` resource is the whole house \
         as one JSON document. Automations are flows: `list_flows` and `get_flow` read them, \
         `set_flow` creates or replaces one (validated against the house, saved retained on \
         `oikos/automation/<id>`, the prefix being configurable), `set_flow_enabled` \
         switches it and `delete_flow` removes it; `run_flow` starts a manual run. A flow's optional `area` (an area id; a room name is resolved) is the room the UI lists it under; it does not change what the flow does. `set_virtual` and `delete_virtual` manage virtual \
         entities (a `switch`, `number`, `button` or `select` the hub owns, as `virtual_<id>`) for flows \
         to read and write. `list_groups`, `set_group` and `delete_group` manage flexible \
         groups (hub-published entities as `group_<id>` whose definition — kind, members, \
         hideMembers — is retained at `oikos/group/<id>/definition`); the hub fans group \
         commands out to member entities and republishes the combined state as members \
         change. Ambiances are one-tap house states: `list_ambiances`, `set_ambiance` (create or replace, validated against the house, retained on `<ui_prefix>/ambiances/<id>`), `delete_ambiance` and `apply_ambiance` (runs the actions once, in order, and returns one report line per action: `ok`, `failed` or `skipped` with the entities and reasons). An action is `category` (`what`: `lights`, `plugs` or `covers`; `to`: `on`/`off` or `open`/`close`; optional `brightness` in %, `area`, `except`. The set is resolved at apply time, so new devices are included; only switches typed `showAs: plug` are plugs; an untyped switch is a plain switch and is left out), `device` (`entity` plus the same `command` JSON as `send_command`), `climate` (`zone` or null for every active zone, `setpoint` and/or `mode` for `hours`, or `clear: true`) or `flow` (`flow` id, `do`: `enable`, `disable` or `run`). \
         A flow is a \
         graph of nodes: `trigger.state` (an entity's state changes), `trigger.signal` (a remote press, an event or a tag scan: `entity` is a `device_automation.*`, `event.*` or `tag.*` id and `signal` optionally names one of its announced signals; the trigger value is the signal name, and `trigger.state` is refused on those entities), `trigger.schedule` (a \
         5-field cron in the house local time; it fires only while the flow is enabled and \
         the first run is at the next tick), `flow.enable` (sets another flow's `enabled`, or its own flow when `flow` is absent; a flow \
         that disables itself still finishes the current run), `if` (compares a value; edges \
         leaving it name the port `true` or `false`; `missing` is `fail` (the default), `true` \
         or `false` and picks that port when the value is unknown; `average` (`15m`, at most `24h`) compares the mean of the entity's readings over that window, the newest included, instead of its current value; `value` must be a number), `switch` (1 to 10 ordered `rules` of `op` `eq`, `ne`, `gt`, `lt`, `gte`, `lte` or `between` (`value` to `to`, both included) on `entity` or the triggering value, with optional `average` as for `if`; edges leaving it name the port `\"1\"` to `\"n\"` (the rule's position) or `\"otherwise\"`; `otherwise: true` adds that port, `all: true` takes every matching rule), `time.between` (`from` included, `to` excluded, `HH:MM` in the house local time; ports `in` and `out`), `delay` (`for`: `5m`, `1h30m`; \
         with `up_to` it waits a random time between the two), \
         `command` (the same JSON as `send_command`) and `notify` (a phone push: `title`, optional `body`, `channel`, `severity`, `entity_id`, \
         `image_url`, `silent`, `id`, `lang`). Its `title` and `body` take placeholders filled at \
         run time: `{{entity_id}}` is the entity's value with its unit (`{{weather_temperature}}` \
         → `10.1 °C`), `{{trigger}}` the value that started the run, `:N` rounds to N decimals \
         (`{{weather_temperature:0}}`), and `+ - * /` with spaces around them plus parentheses do \
         maths (`{{weather_today_max - weather_today_min:1}}`). A `math` card computes one number \
         from its `inputs` (entity readings, optionally `average`) with a `formula` such as \
         `clamp(heater - 100 - grid, 0, 1650)` and a result `name`; `save_to` (a number entity) \
         receives it. Later `if` and `switch` cards compare it with `result`, a `command` sends it \
         with `value_from`, and a notify text prints it as `{{name}}`, all within the same run. Text and on/off values are \
         written in `lang` (`en`, the default, or `fr`: pass the language the user writes in). \
         `{{{{` and `}}}}` are literal braces; a value that is unknown at run time prints `?`. \
         `if`, `switch` and `trigger.state` take an optional `field` naming a value inside the \
         entity's state (vacuum `battery`, `fan_speed`; light `brightness` in %; cover \
         `position`; climate and water heater `current`, `target` …); `average` works on a \
         field only when it is the entity's recorded number (cover position, current \
         temperature). Diagnostic entities (battery, link quality) are ordinary entities: name \
         them in `entity`. \
         Entity ids come from `search` or `list_entities`. For \"N minutes after the last \
         motion\" use `mode: restart`, so \
         every new trigger restarts the wait; the default `single` ignores triggers while a \
         run is active. Sun events use `trigger.sun` with `which` one of `sunrise`, `sunset`, \
         `dusk` (civil), `dawn` (civil), and an optional `offset_minutes` in [-720, 720]. A \
         `trigger.manual` card (optional `value`: a bool, number or string the run carries as its \
         trigger value) starts a run only by hand: `run_flow` with its id as `node`. `if` \
         with `op: is_dark` is true between civil dusk and civil dawn at the configured point; its \
         optional `offset_minutes` in [-720, 720] moves dusk by that much and dawn by the \
         opposite (`-30`: dark 30 minutes earlier in the evening and until 30 minutes later in \
         the morning). \
         Off-peak: `trigger.off_peak` with `edge` `start` or `end` fires when off-peak starts \
         or ends (trigger value `\"start\"` / `\"end\"`), and `if` with `op: is_off_peak` (no \
         operand) is true during off-peak. Off-peak comes from the home settings' \
         `off_peak_device` (`{{entity, values}}`: the entity whose state, matched as `on`/`off`, \
         a plain number or its text, is one of `values`) when that entity has a usable \
         reading, else from the `off_peak` windows; with neither it is never off-peak. \
         `trigger.silent` (`entity`, `for` from `1m` to `168h`) fires once when the entity has \
         sent no report for `for`; it fires again only after the entity reports and goes silent \
         again. A report is any state message, changed or not. The clocks start when the flow \
         is saved or enabled and when the broker link returns, are frozen while the link is \
         down, and are forgotten by a hub restart. The trigger value is the `for` text. \
         `limit` (`max` 1 to 100, `per` `1m` to `168h`) lets a run through at most `max` times \
         in any rolling `per` window and ends the run there once the limit is reached \
         (nothing after it runs); its counts live in memory and reset on a hub restart. A \
         typical alive check is `trigger.silent` then `limit` then `notify`. A `trigger.state` \
         with a `to` (and no `from`) also fires when the value was unknown, confirmed by a \
         report, and then becomes `to`; it never fires on the first value seen after boot. \
         Set `[flows] latitude` and `[flows] longitude` in `oikos.toml`; the hub falls back to \
         Paris otherwise and reports a warning on save. `get_history` returns one slice of an entity's history — a chart \
         series (`what: series` with `range`), kWh per day (`daily` with `days` and \
         `kind`), kWh since midnight (`today` with `kind`), or `last_change` — when \
         `[history] url` is set in the hub's config. `send_notification` sends a phone push (`title` \
         required; `channel` alarm, security, camera, energy, climate, system or misc; `severity` \
         info, warning or critical; the same `id` replaces an earlier alert) and `list_alerts` \
         returns the recent ones, newest first. Climate (when `[climate] enabled`): each area with a \
         climate device is a zone (`off`, `pending`, `active`). `climate_status` shows every \
         zone's reading, decision and why (`source`, `reason`), overrides and pending proposal. \
         The engine learns rules from history and proposes them; nothing applies until \
         `approve_climate_proposal` (or the push button). Safety (frost, overheat, stale \
         readings) always acts. A temperature set by hand holds until the zone's next scheduled \
         change, at most `manual_hold_max_min`. Eco: `set_climate_settings` holds `eco` (`heat`, \
         `cool`, `actions` such as `{{\"fan_mode\":\"low\"}}`), never above a zone's schedule; \
         `set_climate_eco` puts one zone in eco until a Unix time and `clear_climate_eco` ends it; \
         the hub's alarm (`oikos_alarm_house`, listed in `presence` or not) or an alarm panel in \
         `presence` that is armed away means nobody home, whatever a tracker says and with no \
         `away_grace`, so every zone is in eco. `get_weather` returns the outdoor weather when \
         `[weather] enabled`. `get_solar` returns the Solcast solar forecast (today, tomorrow, the \
    next days, the request budget) when `[solcast] enabled`; its `solar_…` entities carry the same \
    numbers. `get_home_settings` and `set_home_settings` read and replace the whole \
    home settings document: `eco_setpoint` (°C), `mode_entity` (a select), `indoor_entity` (a \
    temperature sensor), `cold_below` and `hot_above` (°C, the web reads cold below 15 and warm \
    above 26 when unset), `energy_view` (`classic`, `flux` or `orbite`, the web Energy page's live \
    diagram). The native alarm is optional (`enabled` in its settings): \
    `alarm_status` reads the settings and the panel state, `set_alarm_settings` replaces the \
    whole document (read it first). Arm and disarm with `send_command` on `oikos_alarm_house`, \
    `{{\"type\":\"arm\",\"mode\":\"away\"}}` or `{{\"type\":\"disarm\"}}`; there are no codes.",
