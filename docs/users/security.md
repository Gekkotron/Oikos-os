description: What the hub does not protect in v1, what that means for your LAN and how to keep it off the internet.
---

There is no authentication yet, and that is deliberate for v1. The hub binds on `0.0.0.0` (the HTTP bind address, port 8081 by default) and serves the REST API, the WebSocket, the MCP endpoint and the web UI on that one listener, with no login on any of them. It answers any origin (CORS `*`) and its MCP endpoint accepts any `Host` header. Any device on the LAN, and any web page open in a browser on the LAN (through DNS rebinding), can therefore read the whole house and send commands, alarm arming and disarming included. Authentication and TLS arrive in a later phase.

No port forwarding, and no exposure through a reverse proxy without authentication in front of it.

## The native alarm

The hub can run the alarm itself, optional and off by default (see [Alarm](alarm.md)). It has **no codes or PINs**: the panel asks for none to arm or disarm, because the hub has no authentication to protect a code with. Anyone who can reach the hub on your LAN can disarm it, and the remote and push Disarm buttons work without any check. Keep the alarm's sirens and the hub on your own network, and read the caveat above before you rely on it.

## Settings and secrets

The setup and settings routes have no login either: anyone on the LAN can read or change the hub's settings, and can reach the wizard of a hub that has not finished setup. Secrets are write-only through the API (a read says only `{"set": true}`), the MQTT, database and Frigate passwords must be entered again when their address (host and port) changes, and no log line or error carries one. They are stored in the hub's database (and in `data/settings-cache.json` and `data/hub.json`, both readable by the hub's user only). Back up and protect `./data/` and the database like any other secret store. See the [Settings reference](../reference/configuration.md#secrets).

## What else to know

- `get_entity` and the `bindings` it returns hand out the raw discovery config; for a bridge other than Zigbee2MQTT that config could carry credentials in topics or templates.
- With a Frigate address set (**Settings → Cameras**) the hub also fetches alert media from Frigate with the configured login. It only ever requests an event's `snapshot.jpg`, `clip.mp4` or `thumbnail.jpg` on that origin and follows no redirect (plus, with live view on, a camera's `latest.jpg` and MJPEG stream, and `/api/config` for the camera list, which it never passes on), but any LAN client can request those, so give it a Frigate *viewer* account, not the admin. See [Cameras (Frigate)](cameras.md).
- Flows are retained on the broker in clear, so the hub refuses a flow whose `command` node carries an alarm code. Arm and disarm from a flow only on a panel that needs none. See [Flows](flows.md).
